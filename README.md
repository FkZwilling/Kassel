'Kassel' is a tourism website for the city of Kassel. 
It is designed to give some amount of infromation, but is mainly designed to spark interest in both the city and travel to it in the user.
It is not intended as a comprehensive travel resource, but rather as a medium to generate greater appeal than flat wikipedia articles or points on a map, without overwhelming the user.

:Header:
The header is designed to be pleasing to the eye without appearing overly formal. It allows for navigation between home, the gallery and the newsletter signup page, a dropdown menu allows for easier navigation and a more space saving design on mobile devices.
The title in the header spells out the city name in both the modern and old german manner of spelling, to make the header appear less empty, more interesting and play on the cities historical background

:Homepage:
The homepage is endowed with a hero image to give a general visual idea of the city itself and three short articles each with an attached image, to outline possible points of interest the user may have in the city. It too was designed with mobile devices in mind.

:Gallery: 
The gallery serves to give a broader visual representation of the city, that is less limited and more intentional than a simple google search
All images are equipped with an alt attribute for screen readers and adjust size for different screens.

:Newsletter:
'Newsletter' or the newsletter signup page, allows the user to sign up to a newsletter with customizable interests. 

:Footer:
The footer provides contact information in form of a fake email address and phone number and a link to the newsletter page

No code was copied in from external sources, though I made use of both the Love-Running project and my mentors Animal-Shelter project for cross referencing and inspiration.
All images were procured from istockphoto.com in the context of a free membership trial.
The newsletter utilizes the dump link provided for the Love-Running signup page.
Google searches were used for troubleshooting but no concrete website referenced at any point.
